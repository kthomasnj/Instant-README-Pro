  ## How to Contribute
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

  How to contribute: It was mostly an individual project. Daniel Merkin helped when I had questions. I also used content from our class Zoom recordings.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Throughout the creation of this program I used many console logs to determine what data was contained in my variables.
